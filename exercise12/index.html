        <h2>Ender's Game</h2>
        <div>
          <p class="author">by Orson Scott Card</p>
          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <div class="spoiler">Only in Ender does the military find an ideal balance of the two
          extremes for their purposes: someone who can understand his enemies with perfect empathy
          and still remain capable of ruthlessly defeating them. Ender is only 6 years old when he
          is sent to the orbiting Battle School. There, he faces a merciless regimen designed to
          turn him into an unbeatable military opponent and thus ensure the survival of the
          species. While Ender struggles to survive with his own humanity intact, Peter and
          Valentine watch with growing concern the deteriorating pacts between earth�s political
          alliances, and devise their own plan to unify earth against the internal threat of chaos
          and anarchy. Though they are not yet adolescents, their brilliance carves a path that
          will, for better or worse, end with Peter ruling the world. For their younger brother,
          Ender, an even darker path waits, one that leaves him no choice for happy endings, no
          matter which way he turns. Long after you've set the book down, you'll be haunted by the
          ghosts of Ender's bitter despair at his dark side, Valentine's unwavering loyalty and
          love for her younger brother, and the unexpected revelations of the denouement. Card�s
          keen insight into human motivation and family ties, and his ability to create characters
          that arouse stark emotion and empathy in the reader, make this story a classic that
          continues to stand the test of time ...</div>

          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <div class="spoiler">The Telmarines long ago invaded Narnia from the nearby country of
          Telmar. They drove out the Old Narnians and slaughtered nearly all o them. They went into

        <h2>BRISINGR</h2>
        <div>
          <p class="author">by Christopher Paolini</p>
          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <div class="spoiler">Eragon represents the greatest hope for a better Alagaesia. Can
          this once simple farm boy rise to become a leader who can unite the rebel forces and
          defeat the King? Following the colossal battle against the Empire's warriors on the
          Burning Plains, Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, have narrowly escaped with their lives.
          Still there is more at hand for the Rider and his dragon, as Eragon finds himself bound
          by a tangle of promises he may not be able to keep, including Eragon's oath to his cousin
          Roran to help rescue Roran's beloved, Katrina, from King Galbatorix's clutches.But Eragon
          owes his loyalty to others, too. The Varden are in desperate need of his talents and
          strength, as are the elves and dwarves. When unrest claims the rebels and danger strikes

          come to terms with his role as a leader and the moral obligations that weigh heavily upon
          his young shoulders as a Dragon Rider ...</div>

          <p class="author">Eoin Colfer</p>
          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <div class="spoiler">Twelve-year-old Artemis Fowl comes from a long line of criminal
          masterminds. How this family managed to elude Interpol so many times is beyond me. But
          one thing for sure, young Artemis is not about to put an end to this legacy. After the
          tragic disappearance of his father, Artemis had been helming the family's criminal
          ventures whilst his mother slowly slips into insanity. No longer a billionaire, the
          family is still far from being poor. In order to restore the family''s fortune, Artemis
          set his mind on some gold - fairy gold, to be precise. Thus, in keeping with the family
          motto: Aurum potestas est , "gold is power". But fairy gold will not come cheaply - nor
          easily at that! First, Artemis had to prove his theory that fairies exist, and that they
          actually own gold to be stolen in the first place. Enlisting the help of his trusty
          bodyguard (whom had been his charge since birth) and his bodyguard's sister, Artemis'

        <h2>The Last Unicorn</h2>
        <div>
          <p class="author">by Peter S. Beagle</p>
          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <div class="spoiler">There was a unicorn that lived in a wood. Since unicorns are
          immortal and solitary creatures that exist outside of time, the space where this unicorn
          dwelt was never touched by the passing years. Unicorns have no need of company, being
          completely fulfilled with their own being. It is enough for them to know that others like
          themselves exist. But one day the unicorn overhears a conversation between two hunters.
          They are pondering the legends they have heard about the mythical horned animal. It seems
          one hunter recalls rumors of a unicorn in his great-grandfather�s day, but nothing
          since�a shame, really. The hunters ride on, leaving the unicorn with a growing unease.
          Surely she can�t be the last unicorn left in the world? She decides to go in search of
          the other unicorns, just to put her mind at peace. As she ventures out into the world,
          she finds that matters are more dire than she had supposed. Not only have all the other
          unicorns vanished without a trace, but people have also lost the ability to recognize the
          last unicorn for the immortal wonder that she is. In fact, when the unicorn is captured
          by a witch and displayed in a seedy traveling menagerie, the witch must mesmerize the
          audience before they see the white mare before them is really a unicorn. The unicorn is
          freed by the traveling circus� resident magician, Schmendrick, who doesn�t have the
          ability to cast a single spell, and resorts to picking the lock on the unicorn�s cage. As
          a reward, the unicorn reluctantly allows him to accompany her on the quest ...</div>
