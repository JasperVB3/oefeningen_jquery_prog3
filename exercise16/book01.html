    <h2>The Crippled God</h2>
    <p class="author">by Steven Erikson</p>
    <div id="text">Savaged by the K'Chain Nah'Ruk, the Bonehunters march for Kolanse, where waits an unknown
    fate. Tormented by questions, the army totters on the edge of mutiny, but Adjunct Tavore will
    not relent. One final act remains, if it is in her power, if she can hold her army together, if
    the shaky allegiances she has forged can survive all that is to come. A woman with no gifts of
    magic, deemed plain, unprepossessing, displaying nothing to instill loyalty or confidence,
    Tavore Paran of House Paran means to challenge the gods -- if her own troops don't kill her
    first.</div>
