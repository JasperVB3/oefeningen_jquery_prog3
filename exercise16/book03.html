    <h2>Mistborn: The Final Empire</h2>
    <p class="author">Brandon Sanderson</p>
    <div id="text">For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa
    slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the "Sliver of
    Infinity," reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when
    hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken
    half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. Kelsier
    "snapped" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader,
    he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier
    recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom
    shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does
    he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the
    divine despot.</div>
