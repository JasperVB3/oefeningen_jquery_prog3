    <h2>The Dragon Keeper</h2>
    <p class="author">Robin Hobb</p>
    <div id="text">Guided by the great blue dragon Tintaglia, they came from the sea: a Tangle of serpents
    fighting their way up the Rain Wild River: the first to make the perilous journey to the
    cocooning grounds in generations. Many have died along the way. With its acid waters and
    noxious airs, it is a hard place for anyone to survive. People are changed by the Rain Wilds,
    subtly or otherwise. One such is Thymara. Born with black claws and other abhorrences, she
    should have been exposed at birth. But her father saved her and her mother has never forgiven
    him. Like everyone else, Thymara is fascinated by the return of the dragons: it is as if they
    symbolise the return of hope to their war-torn world. Leftrin, captain of the liveship Tarman,
    also has an interest in the hatching; as does Bingtown newlywed Alise Finbok, who has made it
    her life's work to study all there is to know of dragons.</div>
